## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned
With this challenge, I learnt CSS Flexbox and was able to grasp the basic idea of it. While there still is a lot to learn and fine-tune, I am happy about the progress I was able to make. 
Below are some snippets from my code:

```css
.box {
  display: flex;
  width: 95%;
  height: 60%;
  margin: 1.8rem 1.8rem 1.8rem 2.5rem ;
}
.info-box > h2 {
    line-height: 40px;
}
```

### Continued development

Going forward, I will improve my on my knowledge and usage of Flexbox and also begin to implement CSS Grid into my stylings.


### Useful resources
